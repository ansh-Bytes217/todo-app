Deployment Guide for Todo List App
This document explains how to deploy the Todo List App built with React and TailwindCSS to various platforms. We will cover deployments for Vercel, Netlify, and GitHub Pages.

Deployment to Vercel
Vercel provides an easy way to deploy React apps with just a few clicks. Follow these steps:

Steps:
Push the project to GitHub:

If you haven't already, push your project to a GitHub repository:

/* write in bash*/
BASH:
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/todo-app.git
git push -u origin main

Create a Vercel Account:

Go to Vercel and create an account if you don't have one already.

Link your GitHub repository to Vercel:

After logging in to Vercel, click the New Project button.

Select your GitHub repository (if not already linked, you'll be prompted to connect your GitHub account).

Vercel will automatically detect the project type (React) and configure everything for you.

Configure Project:

Vercel should automatically detect the necessary build settings for a React app.

If needed, set the build command to npm run build and the output directory to dist (for Vite).

Deploy:

Once everything is set up, click Deploy. Vercel will automatically build and deploy your app.

After deployment, Vercel will provide a URL where your app is live!
